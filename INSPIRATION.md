# Portfolio inspiration & direction

Curated ideas from standout developer and designer portfolios, used to guide this site’s design and motion.

## References to browse

- **[Killer Portfolio](https://killerportfolio.com/)** – Curated list of strong portfolios (personal, design, development). Filter by “Development” for dev-focused examples.
- **[Typewolf – Portfolio sites](https://www.typewolf.com/portfolio-sites)** – Top 40 focused on typography and layout.
- **Notable examples from research:**
  - **Bruno Simon** – 3D WebGL “drive through” experience (high effort, high impact).
  - **Jackie Zhang** – Interactive scrapbook feel.
  - **Yuki Asakura** – Scroll-as-subway-window narrative.
  - **Fine Thought** – Code-editor style layout.
  - **Ashley Willis / Braydon Coyer** – Clean, conversational, strong case studies.

## What we applied here

1. **Framer Motion** – Scroll-triggered section reveals, staggered hero and lists, hover/tap micro-interactions. Keeps motion subtle and respectful of `prefers-reduced-motion`.
2. **Strong typography** – Outfit for headings, clear hierarchy, gradient accent on the hero name for a bit of “premium” feel without clutter.
3. **Clear structure** – Numbered sections (01–06), obvious CTAs (View work, Get in touch), and a single flow: Hero → About → Skills → Projects → Experience → Contact (+ Blog).
4. **Polish** – Staggered entrances, card lift on hover, and consistent teal accent so the site feels cohesive and intentional.

## If you want to go further

- **Framer (framer.com)** – Design and prototype high-fidelity layouts and interactions, then implement in Next.js (or export where it fits). Good for trying bold layouts before coding.
- **More personality** – Replace placeholder copy in About and `lib/site.ts` with your real story and tone.
- **Case studies** – Add a project detail page per project: problem, approach, tech, outcome, and visuals (like the “best” portfolios).
- **One bold idea** – Consider one signature touch: e.g. a small 3D object, a custom cursor, a horizontal scroll strip, or a code-block style section, without overwhelming the rest of the site.

Your stack (Next.js, Tailwind, Framer Motion) is the same kind used by many top portfolios; the main differentiator is content clarity and one or two memorable design or interaction ideas.
