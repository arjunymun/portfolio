This is your first blog post. Edit or add more `.md` (or `.mdx`) files in `content/blog/` to publish new posts.

## How it works

- Each file's **front matter** (the block between `---`) sets `title`, `date`, and optional `excerpt`.
- The rest is rendered as Markdown on the post page.

Replace this content with your own and customize `lib/content.ts` and `lib/site.ts` for your portfolio.
